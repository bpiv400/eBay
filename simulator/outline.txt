Current buyer offer:
- delay in days
- time-valued features at time of byr offer
- normalized price
- indicator for rounded
- indicator for nines
- indicator for msg

Seller offer (for delay model):
- days [last]
- time-valued features [last]
- norm [last]
- is_round [last]
- is_nines [last]
- msg [last]

Seller offer (for concession model):
- days [curr]
- time-valued features [curr]
- norm [last]
- is_round [last]
- is_nines [last]
- msg [last]

For buyer model:
- how to predict 4th move (accept or reject)?
- how to predict delay?
- estimate a poisson arrival process with parameter \lambda using a feed-forward net.
- predict delay for subsequent offers (delay = 0 for first offer).
- for RL, begin threads by drawing from exponential(\lambda)
