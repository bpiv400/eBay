data/exps/exp_name/turn/norm.csv -- df with two columns (mean and std) for all
    columns except the response variable
data/exps/exp_name/turn/bins.pickle  -- pickle containing dictionary with two entries 
    bins and midpoints 
data/models/exps/exp_name/loss_turn.pickle -- list of losses for each minibatch
 data/models/exps/exp_name/featdict_turn.pickle -- dictionary of feature 
 names mapped to column index in the data matrix for the model
 
 data/models/exps/exp_name/class_series_turn.csv -- series where index gives
 the original value of a the response variable (in dollars) and the 
 value of the series gives the corresponding class index in the case 
 of classification based models...In regression based models, 
 the index of the series also corresponds to the value of one of the bins, 
 but the value of the series corresponds to the index of that value 
 in the expectation layer of the model
